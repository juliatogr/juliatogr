# Welcome to juliatogr GitHub Repo 👋

I am Júlia and I amcurrently studying an Audiovisual Systems Engineering because I am passionate about both technology and audiovisuals.
I aim to be a Software Developer at an audiovisual company.

Here you can find some of

- 💻 Java exercises done during the Back-End Java course at IT Academy - Barcelona Activa.
- 🗃 SQL & MongoDB to create databases for the exercises last mentioned
- 👾 Games developed in C++ as homework for the degree at Pompeu Fabra University
- 🎹 Audiovisual projects in Python also for the University.
- 🖼 Front-End in JavaScript/CSS/HTML to develop the visual interfaces on some aplications at both IT Academy and UPF.

This is the resume of my activity on GitHub:
